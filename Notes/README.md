# Notes

What is React Native? 

A way to create Mobile Apps for iOS or Android that uses similar development process as React.js. The major difference is using native UI element by using special components, this also enables native platforms with APIs exposer to JS.

The code will be rewritten in React but using React Native component and APIs to create a React Native application.

From this point forward, if you see reference to "Native", just assume it is referring React Native.

## React Native Components

The Components compile for the specific systems, but have generalize terms that will then allow them to compile correctly to the related hardware. 

| Web         | Android        | iOS          | Native JSX   |
| :---        |    :----:      |    :----:    |    :----:    |
| `<div>`     | `android.View` |  `UIView`    | `<View>`     |
| `<input>`   |  `EditText`    | `UITextField`| `<TextInput>`|
