# Notes

What is React Native? 

A way to create Mobile Apps for iOS or Android that uses similar development process as React.js. The major difference is using native UI element by using special components, this also enables native platforms with APIs exposer to JS.

The code will be rewritten in React but using React Native component and APIs to create a React Native application.

From this point forward, if you see reference to "Native", just assume it is referring React Native.

## CLI

Allow to get you application up to the app store.

_Expo CLI vs Native CLI_

[*Expo*](https://docs.expo.dev/) is a free third party service. There is a pay option. 

Give you an "managed app development", is convenient and provide great functionality. 

It can be left at any time.

*Native* is provided first and is provided by Native directly and is supported by them.

Is bare-hones deployment and requires more set up.

It is less convenient features.

Is easier to integrate with native source code, (Java, Objective-C, Kotlin or Swift).

*Both can and should be used together.*

Is Native almost just a compile time specific system to enable mobile access?
