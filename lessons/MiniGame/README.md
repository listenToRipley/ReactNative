# Mini Game

What's the game?

Provide a number and have the computer guess it.

## Business Logic

We start with a screen that allows you to provide a number.

The number should be between 1-99.

Once a number is entered, we need to start the game.

We will move to another screen where the game really starts.

The computer will provide a number. 

If the number is too high, then let the computer know it is too high.

If the number is too low, then let the computer know.

You should have an option to reset the game.

There should be another option that lets the computer know the number matches the given number.

### Win Conditions

If the computer guesses the provided number, the game over and we move to another screen.
